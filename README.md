🧬 Prognosis of Ovarian Cancer Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on Ovarian Cancer Detection and Prognosis using advanced Vision Transformer (ViT) models on histopathological images.

The system analyzes:

🔬 Neutrophils

🧫 Macrophages

⚫ Necrosis regions

📊 Patient survival correlation

The goal is to assist medical professionals in predicting ovarian cancer prognosis using AI-based image analysis.

🎯 Project Objective

Detect cellular components from histopathological images

Classify immune cells (Neutrophils, Macrophages)

Identify necrotic tissue regions

Correlate findings with patient survival data

Improve early-stage prognosis prediction accuracy
